            <p>I always loved games. I have always had a passion for art since I was able to hold a pencil and put it to paper. I am Graphic Artist from Chicago, IL that graduated from Heartland Community with an Associateâ€™s in Graphic Design. Now, I am pursuing my Bachelor's in Game Design. This is something that I have always dreamed of doing is making my own games. The classes are challenging and will keep you on your feet. I am looking forward to what my journey holds within Game Design. The Game that I really proud to make with a group of classmates that I can trust is called Greed City. More Projects coming SOON!
